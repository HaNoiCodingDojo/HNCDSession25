# B's
- several paradigms with functional, object-oriented thanks to python, smalltalk, clojure
- different languages
- show paradigms have different "units"
- new people :)

# C's
- lost focus several times
- not lowering expectations of the domain

# One-liners to do CountdownKata
- Python: `range(10, -1, -1)`
- Smalltalk: `(10 to: 0 by: -1) asArray`
- Ruby: `(0..10).to_a.reverse`
- Haskell: `[10,9..0]`
- Clojure: `(apply vector (range 10 -1 -1))`
